# Data Integration API - Web Service

A quick test project to help investigating a use case with another project.

  - WebApi Core web service to receive image and perform object detection using ML.NET and a pre-trained YOLO model
  - Powershell test script to interate through files in the data folder (PowerShell 6/core required)
